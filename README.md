## Project Overview

The ONED project aims to provide a secure, accessible, and privacy-focused platform for sharing inter and intra-employee details and assets across various companies. The platform addresses issues such as fake experience, forged offer letters, and other fraudulent documents, ensuring the verifiability of employee claims through fact-checking mechanisms. ONED will be developed using the GO programming language, chosen for its speed, reliability, and strong community support.

## Platform Pillars

1. **Privacy:** Protecting the confidentiality and anonymity of individuals' data and information shared on the platform.
2. **Security:** Implementing robust security measures to safeguard sensitive data and prevent unauthorized access or tampering.
3. **Accessibility:** Ensuring ease of access and usability for all authorized users across different companies.

## Key Features

1. **Document Verification:**
   - Enable companies to share employee-related documents such as offer letters, certificates, etc., with verifiable signatures.
   - Utilize advanced cryptographic techniques to generate and verify signatures without revealing sensitive information.
   - Allow companies to authenticate documents uploaded by candidates, detecting any discrepancies or forgeries.

2. **Distributed Architecture:**
   - Implement a distributed network architecture to enhance security and ensure data integrity.
   - Utilize decentralized storage and consensus mechanisms to distribute data across multiple nodes, reducing the risk of single-point failures and unauthorized access.

3. **Fact-Checking Mechanism:**
   - Incorporate a fact-checking system to verify the authenticity of employee claims.
   - Enable companies to cross-reference employee data and documents against a centralized database to detect inconsistencies or false information.

4. **Open-Source Availability:**
   - Offer an open-source version of the ONED platform freely available to the community.
   - Encourage community contributions and collaboration to enhance platform features, security, and reliability.

## Platform Protocols

1. **Data Encryption:**
   - Employ end-to-end encryption to protect data during transmission and storage.
   - Utilize cryptographic algorithms such as AES for secure encryption and decryption of sensitive information.

2. **Authentication and Authorization:**
   - Implement robust authentication mechanisms such as OAuth or JWT to verify user identities and grant access permissions.
   - Enforce role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to confidential data based on user roles and privileges.

## Development Milestones

- **Milestone 1 (Initial Development):** 
  - Set up project repository and basic project structure.
  - Implement user authentication and authorization mechanisms.
  - Develop core functionalities such as document verification and fact-checking.

- **Milestone 2 (Distributed Architecture):**
  - Design and implement distributed network architecture.
  - Integrate decentralized storage and consensus mechanisms.

- **Milestone 3 (Open-Source Release):**
  - Prepare and release open-source version of the ONED platform.
  - Establish community engagement channels and documentation.

- **Milestone 4 (Enhancements and Optimization):**
  - Address feedback from community and stakeholders.
  - Optimize platform performance and security.
  - Explore optional features such as blockchain integration.

## Metrics

1. **Performance:** Measure platform performance in terms of response times, throughput, and scalability to accommodate growing user demands.
2. **Security:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities.
3. **Privacy Compliance:** Ensure compliance with relevant data privacy regulations such as GDPR, CCPA, etc., to protect user privacy rights.
4. **Community Engagement:** Foster an active community of developers, contributors, and users through forums, documentation, and open communication channels.
5. **Reliability:** Monitor system uptime, error rates, and downtime incidents to ensure reliable service delivery.
